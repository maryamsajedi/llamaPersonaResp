Oh, and as for [[User:Catfish Jim and the soapdish]]'s Rfa, it is good! I was really surprised to hear he jumped into the ring of fire without my knowing he planned to do it.. he said he didn't want to look like he might be fishing for votes, which just goes to show what a decent guy he is.. not to mention all those positive votes, and I think, 2 votes not for his Adminship, which is a really decent outcome! I thought you knew him already. You may benefit from doing so. He's been so helpful to me over the last year or so, and is a good editor as well as good at sniffing out vandalism, which is why he finally asked for the mop-- more tools in which to deal with those problems.

The Italian, Japanese, and Indonesian horse breed articles just have extensive see also sections that cross-ref the others, or, if the Spanish horse list is too huge for a see also, we could expand [[Iberian horse]] into a list something along the lines of [[stock horse]] or [[gaited horse]].

I will continue to make edits to various articles (e.g., I've done some work on a few BLP's and extensive research on [[Festival Express]], et. al.) as my schedule permits. I look forward to ''Road Trips Volume 4 Number 5'', to be released in November, 2011. However, considering I wasn't one of the original fortunate 7200 who laid out the requisite $450, I will leave the 73 CD ''[[Europe '72: The Complete Recordings]]'' work to you and others! I definitely don't relish that monumental setlist enumeration chore. As an aside, though, I was wondering about the idea of a template to make to additional of future albums somewhat more streamlined. Might be a worthwhile mini-project to construct in a sandbox?

It is against copyright laws for Wikipedia to host images that are not properly license, let alone images that bear a different license than the one the copyright holder placed on his image.  Any image that is a violation of copyright law should be immediately deleted from Wikipedia.  It is not a question of letting the uploader fix something, the expectation is that it should be properly licensed at the time of uploading, not a couple years after.  Another fact is that the photo in question \\'\\'cannot\\'\\' be used on Wikipedia with the license it has.  If it was simply a question of what the proper license is, and the image was free to host on Wikipedia, than of course I wouldn\\'t have deleted the image, I would\\'ve just fixed it.  In the future, if you don\\'t want your photos to be deleted, make sure that the photos can be used on Wikipedia, and make sure that you mark said photo with the correct license.

The main problem is that this is the Alice Bailey article, and the section isn't about Alice Bailey, it's about [[Channeling]] in general. We have a whole article on that (it seems to be called [[Mediumship]]), and that section would be better directed there. We can't put a long section critical of channeling in general in the article on every mystic, any more than we can put a long section critical of warfare in general in every article on a general, or a long section critical of abortion in general in every article on a feminist.--\",\n",

The Nokota horse article has been designated as a \\\\\"good article\\\\\" under wikipedia\\'s [[WP:GA]] criteria.  That means that to keep this status, all material in it has to be properly footnoted and sourced. (See [[WP:V]] and [[WP:CITE]] for information on sourcing) In addition, any properly sourced material that IS there now should not be arbitrarily removed without a very good reason that is explained and discussed with other editors.  Each of your edits simply removed properly sourced material with no explanation.  I checked your edit history, and it looks like you\\'ve done this in the past as well.  The best way to handle what you want to do is to click on the \\\\\"discussion\\\\\" link at the top of the page, and then on the talk page for the article, explain your concerns.  I noted that the material you removed concerns a dispute between the two Nokota horse organizations.  The dispute itself, at least until settled, is a controversy that is noteworthy and relevant to include. (We\\'ve had to manage a similar set of legal disputes involving the Andalusian horse registries at its article too)  Wikipedia takes a [[WP:NPOV|neutral position]] on these issues and attempts to simply explain the controversy and outline the views of each side.  We can\\'t take sides.  I hope this explains things.  If not, feel free to discuss your concerns at [[Talk:Nokota horse]] and we can try to further sort matters out. ',\n",

If it hasn\\'t happened by mid-day tomorrow I\\'ll check with the bot operator and see what\\'s going on. Hope this helps. ',\n",

       "               'text': \"Thanks for your comments and courtesy. :) Copy of my vote: '''Strong Keep''' \\\\u2013 for both buildings and people. Buildings can be notable, either because of whom they once housed, or for a totally different reason, perhaps they are a famous theatre, or a historic factory. I am not sure whether your list would be colour specific. The term ''blue plaque'' seems to be the generally accepted term even for plaques which are not blue. I take it to mean a circular monument of any colour. This seems to be how bodies such as English Heritage and those linked externally in the Blue plaques article define them. Despite the main text of the {{Low|Blue plaque}} article the awarding bodies are not just English Heritage and the London councils. They are all over England, I have found (and added to category) one in Wales, I don't know whether there are more, and they exist in Northern Ireland [http:\\\\/\\\\/www.ulsterhistory.co.uk\\\\/index.htm]. I would favour keeping the categories. I find categories useful for browsing related articles and exploring unrelated people or buildings with something in common. The fact that a category does not link a person to a building does not reduce this usefulness. The article itself should describe the relationship. Perhaps a list for people and a list for buildings as well as these categories. My current interest is with architecture and history of buildings so I would appreciate indexing from that direction as well. I vote Strong Keep on the assumption that the recording of historical memorials is not frivolous. I realise that blue plaques in parts of the UK may not be of world-wide interest, but they are a very visible and characteristic sight to tourists. The fact that they have been awarded for 140 years suggests that they are not trivial. \",\n",

The criteria that Jappalang is concerned about is [[WP:NFCC]] #8, which states that non-free content should only be used when it \\\\\"significantly increase readers\\' understanding of the topic, and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding\\\\\". If you have a source which gives more \\\\\"critical commentary on the artistic design of the customized plates\\\\\" (Jappalang\\'s wording), then we should add this in to the article in order to make a case for keeping the image. I really don\\'t think that having to remove this image will result in the article being \\\\\"trashed\\\\\", and as I said above, poorly licensed images really need to be removed anyway, FAC or not.

His book was published in 1974. I certainly walked along there various times between 1973 and 1977 and I remember seeing lock gates almost completely buried. I agree that some (possibly a lot) of the top level was lost as a result of subsequent cutting of lower levels. I don't have time this month, but I'll try and find some slides. I should also have some of the Titford canal take at about the same time, i.e. before and after the 1970s restoration. \",\n",

Both books say that the plan was to reduce the Smethwick top level by 18 foot, down to the Wolverhampton level, thereby eliminating three locks at each end of the summmit. They first duplicated the Smethwick locks (453 - 473 ft), then they dug a new canal to the south of the top summit, but 12 ft lower; and used the top summit to take away the spoil. The new canal was filled with water; that eliminated two locks at each end of the old summit, which were filled in. They then dug another new canal to the south, but 6 foot lower and used the 2nd canal to take away the spoil from the third canal. That eliminated the third lock at each end. These two books state that the top level was not destroyed, just the locks filled in. My memory is seeing only the top of the lock gates.  Broadbridge (page 84) says that the Spon Lane locks were brought to light in July 1969 and destroyed by drag line excavator when the ground was prepared for a motorway. Incidentally Hadfield shows a similar view between pages 96 and 97, but it was taken from the railway end of Brasshouse Lane bridge. I cannot at the moment remember if I saw locks at both ends of the summit. I could have been there in July 1969, but the memory I'm talking about was a boat hire over Christmas \\\\/ New Year either 1973 or 1974; we went into a supermarket in Smethwick to buy food for 12 people.\",\n",

It is now accepted that the original course curved across the route of the New Main Line through, or near, what is now the engine house, before swinging back on to the present course.

Then it seems the issue was with sourcing, which I could do something about (I added a specific link to the New York Times 1911 article) but then I read it again, and it seems the issue was that this is a list and not an article, and I don't know much about lists.

Basically, I think the comic book series, the current primary topic, is not a primary topic because it does not have the educational value that the other moves\\' topics have. It is certainly an originating term for other topics, including the 2012 film, but my impression is that origination is not the criteria. My brief research of the comic book series shows that it is well-known but not necessarily educationally valuable. In addition, I also cited the other Spider-Man films\\' popularity to strongly indicate that the 2012 film will be a contender for reader traffic. I ask about this in part because we have some topical pairings out there where we have the source material as the primary topic and the film adaptation as the secondary topic. For example, we have [[Apt Pupil]] and [[Apt Pupil (film)]]. In contrast, we have [[Road to Perdition]] (film adaptation) and [[Road to Perdition (comics)]] (source material). I was not sure how widely \\\\\"educational value\\\\\" could apply, and any feedback would be greatly appreciated. ',\n",

There is a strong argument in [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons]] that all unsourced derogatory or controversial information about living persons should be deleted outright; this whole article isn't obviously at that level, but it isn't that far from it. I looked a while on the web, and I couldn't find any [[Wikipedia:reliable sources]] writing about her, or even backing Alkivar's claim from [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\\\\/Tove Jensen]], which seems to be why it wasn't deleted then. There are lots of image galleries, but that doesn't mean much; the ones who want to publish actual information about here refer ... to our article! I've looked at the PDFs referenced from the article talk page, and they aren't conclusive proof of anything, and even if they were, they would probably be primary sources. :-( The article isn't slanderous, but I strongly doubt it could stand up to another deletion challenge, which makes the question of age rather moot. --\",\n",

       "               'text': 'Hi JaGa. I am always puzzled as to why you ask me to do work which you are as capable of doing yourself as I am. We have spoken about this before. Wikipedia is a volunteer charity project, and people do their best in the time they have available to them, and people will tend to work initially in areas that interest them, and then help out on tedious tasks if they have the time or inclination - but nobody is compelled to do anything (well, other than to take care they are not doing harm). That particular splitting you are talking about was a long and complex one that nobody had done for more than two years because of the amount of work involved. Sending people a nag message at the end of it instead of pitching in and helping out yourself is not conducive to the spirit of support, co-operation and collaboration that embodies the spirit of Wikipedia that I respect and enjoy so much. If you spot a spelling mistake - fix it yourself instead of sending someone a message. If you see that an article needs sourcing, it\\'s acceptable to put a general message on the article asking people who are interested in that sort of work to alert them, but it\\'s even better to do the work yourself; it\\'s not really done to pick on the last person who edited the article to ask them to do all the work. You may not have noticed but I did send a message to those people involved in that article letting them know what had happened, and that clean up work might now be needed as I am not an expert on the topic. I know you are well intentioned, but I have already indicated to you that I am uncomfortable with these messages. I would respect you much more if you pitched in and did the work yourself rather than send people these messages. I would love to know that you were helping out by tidying up after me. I would think that was great. Really I would. How about creating a template to be placed on newly created disamb pages that says that work on sorting them out needs to be done. And the template could put such articles into a category to enable editors to work through all the articles that need attention. I think a general message would be more in the spirit of Wikipedia than putting the weight all on one person. If we make a task too onerous for one person, then that task will be ignored.  <span style=\\\\\"border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;\\\\\">\\'\\'\\'',\n",

As for resourcefulness, [[Clint Eastwood]] is currently undergoing GA and has been put off passing for weeks because the reviewer thought it had to be more comprehensive and kept asking for it to be improved. There just seems to be an extreme difference in what GA reviewers expect for a good article does there not? \\\\u2666 \",\n",

I\\'ve seen some very good reviews from you actually Malleus <s>and some not so good ones<\\\\/s>. But its the same with me, I have produced very good articles and a lot of poor articles. But that\\'s not because I don\\'t care about the project or quality. I\\'ve always tried to meet our goals to \\\\\"built an encyclopedia of the highest quality\\\\\" and \\\\\"the sum of all human knowledge\\\\\" which has meant that the quality of my contributions has often differed dramatically as we only have a limited amount of time to get done what we want. Unfortunately in trying to get some mention of the thousands of topics I\\'ve started on wikipedia to work towards \\\\\"the sum\\\\\" this has affected article quality, often embarrasingly so but I can\\'t accompliosh what I want to in the time I have, that\\'s the problem... I would rather if every sub stub I\\'d created was created as a full length article first time of course... I think it comes down to viewpoint and whether you view wikipedia as an ongoing development which will be around for hundreds of years or an encyclopedia which should be slowly written an article at a time more fully... At times I share either one of these outlooks which is reflective in my writing and the time I spend on each article.... What upset me Malleus was that even before we\\'d really met and conversed you seemed to despise me and viewed me as a \\\\\"bad egg\\\\\". Maybe its because of my many stubs or I\\'ve done something in the past to hack you off in a public forum because of my view on something or other I don\\'t know but I can assure that we are both here to improve wikipedia together... I think it is a \\'\\'good\\'\\' thing that you review so many articles and seem to genuinely want to improve our percentage of good articles. As you say, something motivates us to edit in what at times can be an exasperating and belligerent environment, its the love of knowledge and resourcefulness I think.. Anyway lets put this behind us as you say and in future should our paths cross I will try to show greater respect for each others work\\\\/efforts and hope that you would do the same...  \\\\u2666 ',\n",

It's a phonebook in the sense that to be current a new issue has to come out every year. Unlike, say, an encyclopedia, which is supposed to contain information that is a bit less sensitive to the passage of time than that. A hundred years from now, no one will care that such and such a book shop was there from 2005 through 2007, unless it was a truly exceptionally notable book shop in its own right. They will care if [[Charles Babbage]] or [[Joshua Reynolds]] did something important there, because those were truly exceptionally notable people.

The three places with citation needed tags are probably fine for a GA, but would need to be sourced for FAC, and so could probably use sourcing anyway.

You also may have trouble with the whole section when\\\\/if you go to FAC - they tend to be a bit less forgiving of lists and some reviewers may see it as trivia.

I took a quick look at the article and it looks like you're basically doing a good job. To quickly answer a couple of your questions - references should be inline, not on a seperate page. Sources that you're citing should be footnoted inline, although if you're using multiple pages from one reference (say a book or a long journal article) in different areas you can use a short format inline and give the full reference information in a seperate section. See [[Cleveland Bay]] for an example of the short\\\\/long formatting that I'm talking about - completely different subject, but same general idea. I'll have to take a look at the move history to answer your question on the move, and will do that when I get home. I hope this helps, and again, sorry for the delay - I hope it hasn't impeded your progress in class. More later, \",\n",

Part of the problem with the musician navboxes is that so many people do it the wrong way that if someone saw one done correctly it could be misleading. I agree that it could be more clear, and I'm trying to think of a good (yet unobtrusive) way to indicate inside the navbox that it's not a complete list. While I do like jazz rap, I can't say I'm more a fan of that than other rap; I'm not a massive rap fan but what I like is kind of all over the place. Actually, that's a fair description of most music I like, it's all over the place. Anyway, thanks for understanding\\\\u2014I don't enjoy butting heads with people on here, though it does appear to be an occupational hazard. Peace, \",\n",

It is sourced, reliably, I think with a clip of the group making this statement on a television program. The only problem may be that this clip is at YouTube, which I know is usually frowned upon.

I don't usually review horse articles, because of the possible COI, since it's an area that I work in often with editors that I collaborate with fairly regularly. There's also the issue that GAN is a good way to get outside opinions from non-horsey people, which is a thing that we often have problems with (they tend to spot jargon and technical language way better than we do!). However, there is a group of very good science and history editors out there that often pick up the horse articles. The article has only been up for a week, which is a fairly short waiting period at GAN (unfortunately, there's a fairly constant backlog there). If it's still there in another week with no sign of review, ping me again and I'll drop notes to a few people. \",\n",

But [[Wikipedia:Deletion of all fair use images of living people]] gives some valid points as to why the image could be kept, and your explanation is detailed and specific, so probably it's ok.  It definitely doesn't bother me personally anyway, you can remove the deletion tag.  It could be said that in this case the image is irreplaceable: in order for this article to meet the NPOV policy you need either both or neither picture, and deleting valid material is not a solution.  Perhaps it should be moved from the infobox and placed further down the page as is the case for many actor's articles.  I think as a general rule when users can't agree (\\\\/are not sure ) it is best to keep. \",\n",

While the couple are unknowingly rushing towards the Grand Canyon, a planted [[Arizona State Route 64]] shield is visible. The real AZ-64 leads to the Grand Canyon; however, this scene was actually shot in my usernamesake town of Moab. In the case of US-8 and Back to the Future, if I had to guess,  I'd say the intent was to pay homage to [[Interstate 8]] with that sign.

For example, I got an [[Aerial Achievement Medal]] for every 20 recon missions I flew, even when the missions were as routine as could be. I got a [[Combat Readiness Medal]] for every two years I collected flight pay. Medals mostly just indicate how good your supervisor is at writing up a citation. I\\'ve known chiefs and generals with chestfuls of fruit salad, up to and including the [[Bronze Star]] and [[Legion of Merit]], who were absolutely freaking worthless and couldn\\'t lead sailors into a whorehouse. I\\'ve also known people who accomplished amazing, courageous things who got jack because nobody important happened to be looking. [[Medal of Honor]]? Impressive. Same goes for the [[Silver Star]] and the [[Distinguished Service Cross]]. But even [[Purple Heart]]s and [[Bronze Star]]s are sometimes gimmes now - those medals has been frequently degraded at least since Vietnam (given out for scratches, sometimes), so don\\'t be impressed unless you see the citation. Sorry, didn\\'t mean to rant, but GIs bragging about their medals sometimes makes me want to bring out the smackdown.

World War I, France: a shell landed in my grandfather\\'s trench.  Ripped his right leg, lodged some fragments in his back.  Everyone else was hit even worse.  Nobody came to help them and nobody else could stand up.  So my grandfather started making his way toward the nearest field hospital.  On the way there an ambulance met him and he directed them to his trench, telling them he\\'d keep walking.  They went, but by then it was too late for the rest of his unit: all dead or dying  On the trip back the ambulance driver offered him a ride, and when he declined a second time they ordered him into the ambulance.  Just as he stepped into it a second shell landed, killing everyone else in the ambulance.  By some miracle my grandfather wasn\\'t touched.  So he walked the rest of the two miles to the field hospital.  When a doctor finally saw him the doc asked how he had gotten there and thought it was a lie when my grandfather told the truth.  Not because so many other people had died around him that day, but because he shouldn\\'t have been able to take ten steps on that leg. <font face=\\\\\"Verdana\\\\\">',\n",

Anyway, I worked out a solution with a Korean editor-- We\\'ve decided Madame Aema is soft porn, Ppong is not. They both do show nudity and sexual activity, on screen. We\\'ve decided that since Madame Aema was made only to capitalize on the nudity and sexual activity, it fits in the project. Ppong is a literary adaptation of some artistic quality, and, basically, a sex-farce. (I\\'m still a little uncomfortable with the subjectivity of this decision, but so it goes...) Both get the \\\\\"Erotic film\\\\\" category though. Am I the only one who has difficulty with the Pornography label? It does seem a bit of a value-judgment, at least in my thinking... If something with nudity & strong sexuality is done very well, then it\\'s not porn, it\\'s erotic cinema. On the other hand, porn is porn and there\\'s no mistaking it, if you get my drift. ',\n",

And why won't I do it? It's because you are suggesting I delete the entire list and then readd only the guest stars listed on the official website and that would make the list incomplete. Yes, it would meet the sourcing requirements, but an incomplete list is not FL quality. If you had a list of US Presidents that only had 40, you would probably consider it an absolute travesty and try to fail that list should it be trying for FL status. Well, that's how I feel, and if it means that in order to keep a complete, up to date and quality list that I can't get FL status, then so be it. -- \",\n",

As you can see here [http:\\\\/\\\\/en.wikipedia.org\\\\/wiki\\\\/Talk:Grammy_Award#Records.3F] the other editor is in favor of deleting it from the page. I myself feel that the section needs to remain. I feel that if people want to look up the information, they can go to the Grammy website and look up the information and confirm it with what we have included. Hypo feels that it seems more like original research. I feel that we both have merit, but we feel it would be best for us to have a third opinion. Can you ring in on this?

Also the films are not likely to get their own articles, and most (not all) of the reviews do carry on quite a bit about the actress in question, since she's the star attraction. About Suzuki though, I've long thought she does not belong in Category Japanese porn stars. She's an actress of Japanese (I think) descent who appears in U.S. porn. These ethnic\\\\/nationality issues get sticky though, and removing her from the category might set off some kind of a squabbling storm... \",\n",

I also didn\\'t realize that many of those iron lung people got well enough to get out of the lung. I have a minor suggestion: \\\\\"contracted polio\\\\\" is, IMHO, better wording than \\\\\"caught polio,\\\\\" and more in keeping with the authoritative nature of the article. ',\n",

Other characters (for example, [[A]]) have their own pages in Wikipedia. But for your other question, I agree with you that they're inconsistently linked, but I'm not sure what to recommend. One problem is that the page is already so long that it gets warnings when saved, so if more links are included, the problem will only get worse.

We have a format for their inclusion based on [[WP:FC]] work done already.  I think the best way to get things moving is to call for opinions.  If people don\\'t want to see FLs on the main page they can cast an oppose vote saying so.  I think the most likely ways for FLs on the main page proposal to get derailed is for people to start debating over whether the FC format is the best, whether we should do it daily like TFA or POTD, whether we should wait until later, etc. All of these are just votes against.  In all likelihood, people who want FLs on the main page will either want to do it similar to my way (democratically) or similar to TFA (autocratically).  I am just calling for a vote of persons who want to get going democratically. If they vote for my procedure it can be tweaked like anything else at WP.  I think votes to wait are just votes against us being on the mainpage or votes against a democratic procedure since we are so far beyond where TFA was when they started.

People against formatting per FC are just trying to make it undoable and should just come out and say they are against, IMO.

People who don't want to do it daily don't truly want to expose the daily readers to WPs best work in a normal way like TFA and POTD do.  These people should just say they are satisfied with not being on the main page and vote against. I find it hard to believe someone who wants FLs on the main page and wants some sort of by collective consensus would vote against.  This is a proposal that should be close to what people who want FLs on the main page by collective choice should want.  I don't necessarily want a lot of discussion.  I would prefer 100 support votes and a motion to close debate.  You have a lot of skin in the game here because like me you have 3 FLs although I think yours have more subject overlap than mine do and should not be nominated in the same month.  I would think you probably think your work is deserving of main page exposure.  If so I think you should support this kind of approach.  I imagine there are many alternate voting procedures that would work.  However, a myriad of alternate plans is also a pretty good way to torpedo a proposal.  I would imagine extensive debate on alternate procedures would likely lead us astray from getting this thing going.  The table has actually been revised for LOTD format.  Note those are all lists in the table.  Would you like me to format one of your lists as an example?  It is of course possible that people would just like to see a list of nominees.  I think this however makes the first blush comparison easier.  Debate over whether a table with 500 characters per entry or just a list of list names should be shown is of course another way to bog down the progress.  I proposed it as it is because I think it will work.  If I had a month to nominate something, I would be able to summarize it in 500 characters and figure out which projects should take note of its candidacy.--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] <small>([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|t]]\\\\/[[Special:Contributions\\\\/TonyTheTiger|c]]\\\\/\",\n",

I actually found one that said it probably has no effect.  The HSV reference was the best I could do (I guess I was HOPING for something that shows lysine works, just so I can provide a diff someday that I'm not totally opposed to alternative medicine).  OK, I submit myself for punishment.  As for the other issues, just list them on my page or on the HZ talk page, and we'll cross them off.  \",\n",

For almost every other type of page on Wikipedia (movies, albums, countries, medicines, world leaders, chemicals, etc.) the first image appears within the infobox, not after it. However, the infobox for diseases is relatively new and undeveloped compared to these other categories. The template only dates back to June 5 2005, and the image field ony dates back to January 6 2006. Most of the discussions about it in the past have taken place at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Clinical medicine]] and [[Template talk:Infobox Disease]]. So for the general case of how it should be handled, I'd recommend that you post a message there. For your specific case of [[strep throat]], I have moved the image back out of the infobox to your original location. --\",\n",

I\\'m just trying to correct a common misperception that the Korean language and people are somehow less diverse than those of the other countries of the region. The truth is that the Korean language is many, many times more diverse than other so-called \\\\\"language families\\\\\" in Asia, such as the [[Turkic languages]] or the [[Japonic languages]]. The internal diversity of Turkic and Japonic is all very recently derived (except for perhaps the [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] language among Turkic languages, although even Chuvash vocabulary is readily relatable to forms in other dialects of Turkic through the application of a few simple sound changes), like the diversity of, say, modern dialects of the [[French language]]. French is really just one branch of Vulgar Latin, and it should not be given the status of a \\\\\"language family\\\\\" just because it has mutated and diversified into a plethora of weird-sounding dialects over the course of the past millennium. The Korean \\\\\"language,\\\\\" on the other hand, subsumes many dialects that possess vocabulary that cannot be easily derived from any etymon attested in the Standard Korean dialects of Seoul or Pyeongyang, and much of the rest of the basic vocabulary of these dialects, despite being apparently related to that of Standard Korean, reflects a phonological form that must be extremely ancient, perhaps having diverged from the ancestral form of the word found in Standard Korean as many as 2000 years ago. This means that the Korean language is at least as diverse as the entire [[Romance languages|Romance language family]], and probably more so. ',\n",

I originally wrote that paragraph to reflect several genetics papers that had recently been published on the subject, several of which (mostly written by Chinese authors, as I recall) claimed that the appearance of various closely related haplotypes within the O3-M122 clade indicated a recent Neolithic expansion from the Central Plain of China. It was in vogue among population geneticists a few years back to assume very recent \\\\\"Neolithic\\\\\" origins for many of these widely dispersed haplogroups, and Haplogroup O3-M122 was one of those that they just loved to claim proved a recent Chinese origin of most East Asian ethnicities. The material I have read more recently has debunked most of those claims, however, and it now seems more likely that Haplogroup O3-M122 has an ancient Paleolithic origin somewhere in East Eurasia, while only O3a5 might be closely connected with recent Chinese expansions. Haplogroup O3* is, for example, one of the haplogroups that has frequently been associated with the Austronesian expansion into Polynesia, and I don\\'t think many people would claim that the Austronesian expansion was effected by \\\\\"Han Chinese.\\\\\" I had been wavering on whether to rewrite that paragraph in order to reflect these recent discoveries and changes in interpretation of the spread of the less-derived, \\\\\"backbone\\\\\" haplogroups (i.e., they are now generally believed to be very ancient genetic markers of Paleolithic origin, affected by genetic drift and subsequent diversification among descendant populations), but I think I will go ahead and change that paragraph now in order to quash the growth of any overly ambitious theories on the behalf of our Chinese colleagues.

I'm eagerly anticipating a study that might shed some light on the origin(s) of the Haplogroup C3* element among Koreans; personally, I have a hunch that the Korean C3* element might be related in large part to the modal haplotype of the [[Nivkhs]], because I think that the ancient proto-Koreans absorbed some sort of Nivkh-like population (a lot of Korean people just ''look like'' Nivkhs, and there are many interesting Korean-Nivkh linguistic parallels as well, all of which seem to suggest some sort of Nivkh-related substratum in the Korean language). Another reason for assuming either a recent expansion of C3* among the Koreans or an introduction of C3* into the Korean population from a foreign source (either substratal, e.g. from the proto-Nivkhs, or, less likely, adstratal, e.g. from Mongols or Manchus) is that C3 as a whole is very infrequent among the Japanese and, as far as I know, has not been found at all among samples of Ryukyuans, which suggests that the occurrence of Haplogroup C3 among modern Japanese is probably due mostly to assimilation of either Asian immigrants or Ainus, although the presence of C3a in Japan at a very low frequency suggests that C3 might actually have a long history as a minor haplogroup in Japan. In any case, if there is any truth to the posited proto-historic relationship between (at least a certain segment of) the Japanese and the Koreans, then Haplogroup C3* could not have been a major element among the proto-Korean population of that time, because it is not found among the Ryukyuans and it is only a very minor element in the Japanese population as a whole, whereas it accounts for some one-sixth of the entire Korean population. (Of course, the ratio of C3 in modern Koreans compared to modern Japanese would also make sense if the Japanese were only about 1\\\\/6 to 1\\\\/5 Korean, and the Ryukyuans basically not Korean at all, as that would be sufficient to produce the frequency of C3 that is found among the modern Japanese. In this case, I would guess that Haplogroup N1, which is found among the populations of some cities in Japan, and probably also some O2b1* and O3* in addition to C3* would be attributable to Korean influence. I think the frequencies of those haplogroups among the Japanese would ultimately add up to approximately 1\\\\/5 or 1\\\\/6 of the Japanese Y-chromosome distribution, so this actually might be a good working hypothesis for explaining the presence of C3* among the Japanese but apparent absence from the Ryukyuan population.) \",\n",

       "               'text': 'By the way, I did read that recent report by the Korean geneticists at http:\\\\/\\\\/kgenetics.or.kr. Thank you for the link. Their report seemed to confirm what I had heard previously; namely, that the diversity of Haplogroup C3* is actually greatest in the populations located around the Sea of Japan, particularly on the continental side, in Korea and Outer Manchuria. I think that this region might have been populated by peoples carrying Haplogroup Q* and Haplogroup C3* in Paleolithic times; this meta-population was probably descended from the Asian relatives of the people who had crossed over into the Americas over 10,000 years ago to become the ancestors of the Amerindians. I am currently hypothesizing that the Haplogroup Q component eventually dominated in the American descendants of this prehistoric \\\\\"race,\\\\\" while the Haplogroup C3 component ended up dominating in the East Siberian descendants. I think that the Na-Dene peoples, the Eskimo-Aleuts, and the Yeniseian peoples (Kets, etc.) are all the result of later migrations of the Asian descendants of this \\\\\"Americanoid Asian\\\\\" population, with the Na-Dene and Eskimo-Aleuts following their Amerindian predecessors into the American continent, and the Yeniseians accompanying the Altaics (and perhaps some Uralics, such as the Samoyeds) westward into central-western Siberia. I also believe that the Japanese are essentially a remnant branch of these ancient proto-Americanoids; they generally look much more similar to Amerinds than to mainland Asians in my eyes. The idea that the Koreans have a \\\\\"southern\\\\\" (e.g. Chinese) origin rather than a \\\\\"northern\\\\\" or \\\\\"western\\\\\" (e.g. Siberian) one, though, seems probably correct to me. I know the archaeologists would contest this, but frankly, I believe that archaeology can only provide evidence of cultural similarities and differences; it cannot be used to determine whether the similarities or differences were due to genetic origins or to cultural interactions, and I would claim that it also cannot confidently be used to determine the directionality of influence. It seems just as likely to me that the similarities in archaeological finds between certain parts of Siberia and ancient Manchuria\\\\/Liaoning\\\\/North Korea could be due to a migration \\'\\'from\\'\\' Manchuria\\\\/Korea \\'\\'to\\'\\' Siberia rather than the other way around. Population density should be taken seriously in these considerations; I believe that it is more likely for genes from high-density populations (such as those of Korea or China) to flow into low-density populations (such as those of Siberia) rather than the reverse. In any case, the fact remains that two of the major Y-chromosome haplogroups found among the modern Korean population, O2b1* and C3*, have their greatest diversity precisely in the Korean population and not elsewhere; although O3* and O2b* might have entered Korea from somewhere in China in prehistoric times, interacting with the Paleolithic C3* and Q* carriers, the presence of C3* in other populations of northeastern Asia and Central Asia seems more likely to reflect ancient migrations originating from the region of Manchuria\\\\/North Korea, perhaps resulting in the dispersal of the \\\\\"Altaic\\\\\" languages (which I think might be more accurately termed \\\\\"Manchurian\\\\\" or \\\\\"North Korean\\\\\" languages). Haplogroup O2b1* probably developed in isolation in the southern parts of the Korean Peninsula for a very long time, or perhaps the population that carried it was even in contact with Jomon-era populations of Kyushu.

If you mean the Yellow Sea region, especially western Manchuria\\\\/Hebei, then your claim may not necessarily conflict with archaeological findings. However, further below you go, much less likely. Anyways, the mainstream theory of Korean origin among Korean scholars, as written on a Korean college level history textbook, is that [[Mumun pottery period|new migrants]] exterminated [[Jeulmun pottery period|indigenous populations]] of the Korean peninsula and became the ancestors of modern Koreans. This is due to major changes in subsistence patterns(aquatic resources -> agriculture). However, according to the book, a new theory contrary to the mainstream one has been gaining acceptance recently. The new theory is that changes in subsistence patterns may not necessarily mean changes in its consituents, so the people of [[Jeulmun pottery period]], who are perhaps related to those of [[Hongshan culture]], may have culturally evolved to [[Mumun pottery period]]. Unfortunately, with China claiming that [[Hongshan culture]] is a \\\\\"Chinese\\\\\" civilization[http:\\\\/\\\\/rogerblench.info\\\\/Language%20data\\\\/China\\\\/Geneva%20paper%202004%20submit.pdf], I believe this will only lead to further controversy.

If this is not a fluke due to regional variation within the Manchu population, then it means that only about 16.8% of Manchu males belong to Haplogroup C3, including approximately 8.9% in C3-M217* and approximately 7.9% in C3c-M48. Haplogroup C3c-M48 appears to be a very recently-expanded \\\\\"Altaic\\\\\" haplogroup that is found mainly in Mongolians and Kazakhs. Haplogroup C3c-M48 has not been found in any sample of Koreans as far as I know, and it is also not found among Han Chinese. However, Hammer et al.\\'s \\\\\"Dual origins of the Japanese\\\\\" article reported three Japanese individuals (among their sample of 259) who displayed the M86 mutation, which is believed to be a subclade of C3c that has expanded during historical times, mainly among Siberian Tungusic tribes. I would not be surprised if the sporadic instances of Haplogroup C3c-M86 and Haplogroup N3a-M178 among Japanese (and perhaps also some of the Japanese individuals who belong to the Haplogroup Q-P36, Haplogroup I-P19, and Haplogroup R-M207 clades) were due to the historically recorded invasions of the \\\\u8085\\\\u613c ([[Sushen]], Suksin) to the Hokuriku and Ezo regions of Japan. In fact, I have read on a Japanese website that Haplogroup N is especially frequent in Japan in the area around the Noto Peninsula on the Japan Sea coast, which is part of the Hokuriku region that was invaded by the so-called \\\\\"Sushen\\\\\" (or Mishipase\\\\/Ashipase). In any case, Haplogroup C3c Y-chromosomes have not been found even sporadically among Koreans or Han Chinese, which basically precludes any possibility of a major ethnic mixing between Mongolians and either Koreans or Han Chinese during the historical and proto-historical periods. Haplogroup C3* is found at moderate frequency among both Manchus (approx. 8.9%) and Koreans (approx. 16.5% among South Koreans and approx. 12.7% among Korean Chinese) as well as among northern Han Chinese (as much as 9.5% in a sample of 42 Northern Hans), so the possibility of recent intermixture between Northern Hans, proto-Manchus, and proto-Koreans seems much more likely. The proto-Turco-Mongolians were probably isolated (perhaps by the Gobi Desert) from the East Asian groups and more involved with the Indo-European Scythians and Uralic Samoyeds that dwelt to their west.

Does that mean that Siberians are also Han Chinese? No, of course not. It just means that most present-day Siberians and Han Chinese are directly descended in the maternal line from a female ancestor who lived more recently than the common matrilineal ancestor of most Siberians or Han Chinese and, say, Iraqis. There is also a great deal of evidence to suggest that mitochondrial DNA is directly subject to evolutionary selection, which makes me strongly favor Y-DNA over mtDNA in comparisons among human populations.

I don\\'t understand why there\\'s so much pushback to these concepts, some of which I\\'m drawing from PMID 8499790.

In the first, you have one expert communicating with another expert, indicating the root source of the information, and giving credit for its discovery where appropriate. Citing a review might well indicate laziness on the part of the scholar, but there are other reasons such as where (as you indicate) the review adds value or where the primary material is in a foreign language or otherwise inaccessible. On Wikipedia, we have the unique problem (not shared by other encyclopaedias, who generally don\\'t cite their sources) where the authors are not regarded as experts. Even if some authors are experts, we have no way of proving this and so cannot rely on the authority of the author. By citing a review, one is saying \\\\\"Look, an expert has reviewed the subject and agrees with what the WP article says.\\\\\" Even a poor review is a step above \\\\\"A Wikipedian has reviewed the subject and thinks we should say X\\\\\" as Wikipedians should have no voice at all. The review \\'\\'does\\'\\' add value: it adds the weight of an expert opinion. ',\n",

There are other .png editors out there (including some freebies) that'll do the job as well.

I regret recommending that you go there, as the page appears to be somewhat of a timesink.  Of course, I'm obliged to divulge that FAC isn't entirely immune either, considering Una Smith did similar on a FAC, but at least in that case there were many editors involved so it wasn't one person derailing the FAC.  \",\n",

I agree it's a navigational nightmare for newcomers; I have had some ideas about at least making the individual date pages transcludable onto the main T:TDYK page ''a la'' the various deletion pages, but not the time to suggest it because we're all so busy 1) reviewing hooks, 2) waiting for people to respond to concerns, 3) putting good hooks into the next update and 4) updating the template every six hours or so, reuploading the new image from Commons (which we usually have to do) and protecting it spamming the article talk pages, notifying everyone who deserves credit for creating the article and\\\\/or nominating it, clearing the next update page, archiving the old hooks, and finally deleting the old image if its been uploaded from Commons. Yes, in other words, we're overworked and understaffed (That last series of tasks can take me about 20 minutes; it used to take a half hour). The current system is probably a holdover from the days when hook nominations were less frequent, usually approved and posted as a matter of course with or without sourcing and the template was only updated once a day.<p>As the DYK policies say at the top of the page, we reviewers reserve the right to reject a hook if there are serious problems with an article that would make it reflect poorly on Wikipedia were it linked from the Main Page. I felt that this much discussion about OR probably reflected the aforesaid issues, and those might even be heightened if it appeared on the Main Page (We have seen people use that opportunity to spitefully nominate articles for deletion, forcing them off the Main Page. At least I have. And I wouldn't have been surprised if that had happened here). Yes, these concerns were raised by one editor, but the response and counterresponse cycle didn't help. My suggestion is that if this happens again, move the discussion to the talk page sooner rather than later and resolve them there while you put the nom on hold (I'd be willing to extend the deadline for it a few days and I think other DYK reviewers might as well). \",\n",

A poor little girl had the most dreadful case of [[verruca]]s\\\\u2014a common viral infection of children caused by [[human papilloma virus]], and to which our immunity, usually, rapidly and effectively responds. It turned out that this little girl is not making enough [[T helper cell|lymphocytes]] in her [[bone marrow]] and so cannot fight [[virus|viral]] infections very well. It looks like she will get a bone marrow transplant at [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] (an article that much deserves to be improved). No doubt we will be told more in next week's programme. In the end, her parents were grateful to the chronic verrucas, and logically the virus, without which, her condition would have gone unrecognised and would have lead to serious problems later in her life. Again, I was thinking, I hope Colin is watching this because he will be interested. The commentator called the [[lymphocytes]] \\\\u2014''[[antibody|antibodies]]'', which annoyed me a little, but I forgive her; this is [[Channel 4]] after all. Best wishes. Graham. \",\n",

Yes, [[User:Dozenist]] peppered in some technical terms that are anomoly highlights of a dental anatomy course, but in reality, it seems a little silly that the nav box categorizes and lists things in such an unsually unencyclopedic fashion.  I mean the staples of dental pathology, like [[odontogenic keratocyst|odontogenic keratocysts]], [[eosinophilic ulcer]], [[candidiasis]], [[fibrous dysplasia]] and [[Kaposi sarcoma]] are either absent or put in a day or so ago by myself.  However, these entities are focused on in oral path because of their extreme, diagnostic or even pathognomonic oral symptoms.  At the same time, many can occur anywhere in the body.

I would like to enter some information about the relationship of a pentagram and a magic square, but the people who watch and constantly edit [[pentagram]] are being, what I feel as, too strict.  So, I would instead like to place this information in the [[Lionel Ziprin]] article.  However, because my information is only verified by a private personal tutorial that occurred in 1962, and I could no find anything similar on the web, I was told that this was not enough.  However, I feel that this information is objectively related, whether or not the reasoning behind the relationship is to be believed; the steps to completing the magic square do in fact follow the pentagram.  As I am the editor of the Ziprin page for this information, I feel that this information is not controversial enough, such that I can support it with perhaps a less than entirely adequate verifiability requirement, as most pages and bits of information   fall under as well.  Please let me know what you think after checking out the part about the Jewish\\\\/magic square relationship to the pentagram at the bottom of the [[Talk:pentagram]] page. '''\",\n",

Anyway, I saw your new BCA article and I'm not sure a separate article is needed. Most people in Augsburg actully feel that the FCA is a direct continuation of BCA, not a separate entity. The TSV Schwaben supporters never felt the FCA represented this club too. The main reason for this is that the traditional home of BCA in the north of Augsburg became the base for the new club and the Schwaben side of the club in the south of the city was ignored. There actually is a new BC Augsburg-Oberhausen which claims the name of the old BCA and seems to be doing alright in the [http:\\\\/\\\\/www.fussball.de\\\\/fussball\\\\/servlet\\\\/content\\\\/62?next=\\\\/0708\\\\/013\\\\/052\\\\/033\\\\/310260&tag=50001 Kreisliga Schwaben-Augsburg], leading the league and looking for promotion to the Bezirksliga. I can't find a logo so I don't know how close the conection is. But the suburb Oberhausen is were the old BCA once started.

I am writing here to check whether that source you added did in fact take care of documenting a source for that issue of whether it is classified as a fruit or vegetable, but I don't have the book you used for a reference to look at. The reason it came up is that yesterday another person had changed the text to say it is a vegetable, not a fruit. I reverted that, but wanted to make sure we had sourced the info definitively that described it as a fruit since I've seen a couple of minor, non-academic sources that said otherwise. Most sources I've seen mention it being a fruit, but they are mostly sources on the history rather than the biology of the plant. You could reply at the article talk page or here, either one. \",\n",

I think it would be a good idea to lay out some guidelines and points for discussion about just where it is and is not appropriate to stick the codes themselves. I suspect you may start to get more comments like the one above unless there is a central forum for reaching consensus about this effort. For example, many editors might object to sticking ICD-10 codes into the subject headings of an article, as in [[alcoholic liver disease]], since they will probably not be understood by most readers. Might I suggest you start a discussion on [[Talk:List of ICD-10 codes]] or (better yet) a subpage of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine]] where you lay out a systematic plan for ICD-10 coding of articles, so that others can comment on it?

It might be a little bitter, but look hard at the article, compare it to others of the same type, and work hard at managing what is, to folks who are not so passionate about the Croation national team, way too much spin. \",\n",

I noticed that you performed a move and disambiguation on the page [[Fusion protein]], a few months ago, moving that content to the page [[Recombinant fusion protein]]. I\\'d have to say that I don\\'t agree with the usefulness of the current arrangement. I think the concept of a \\\\\"fusion protein\\\\\", as in a polypeptide whose sequence is derived from the \\\\\"fusion\\\\\" of sequences from two originally separate proteins, can and should be discussed on a single page. That page could include separate sections for discussing the various contexts in which fusion proteins appear (recombinant technology, naturally occurring translocations in cancer, evolution, etc) Since you created the disambig page and restricted the scope of the page to [[recombinant fusion protein]], there really isn\\'t an obvious page for me to link to in discussing fusion proteins in the context of translocations, and the meaningful page is now harder for others to find and link to. I\\'ve never heard of [[membrane fusion proteins]] being referred to as simply \\\\\"fusion proteins\\\\\", but if that is a concern, it would be simple to put an {{tl|otheruses4}} link to that page at the top of a restored unitary [[fusion protein]] page. Let me know if you would be amenable to the change. Thanks. -',\n",

The page could then discuss concepts, such as the modularity of protein functional domains, which are common to understanding all \\\\\"fusion proteins,\\\\\" defined as proteins formed through the joining of part or all of two originally separate polypeptide sequences.  Obviously \\\\\"viral fusion protein\\\\\" and \\\\\"membrane fusion protein\\\\\" are unrelated concepts, and if you think we need to link to a disambig page ([[fusion protein (disambiguation)]]) from the main [[fusion protein]] page, we could do that.

In the context of an article on the Croatian national side, the reference to the Delmatas' game is silly and out of place. The Wikipedia article should be encyclopedic, it is not supposed to be some sort of fan page. The article has been through a couple of FAC's now, and although it has been improved hugely, one of the key problems with the thing has been the use of peacock langauage and a clearly nationalistic POV. Get over yourselves and write something that anyone, including a non-Croat, can take seriously. \",\n",

User Domy started upgrading the article on the national team some time ago, and - although considerable improvements have been made to it, he just keeps adding nonsensical and POV information to the article. I stopped editing the article when i realised the flood of nonsense is unlikely to stop (what bothers me mostly is the pretty distorted way the Yugoslavian period and the WW2 are depicted, but i decided it just wasn\\'t worth it wasting time endlessly reverting and discussing it). As for the \\\\\"Croats invented football\\\\\" article, let me just say this: I\\'m Croatian, born and raised in Zagreb, a football fan and I work at Reuters as an intern. Javno.com is NOT a reliable source, it is rarely, if ever, used as a source in other Croatian media; the article itself is based on a Croatian historian\\'s unpublished book (meaning the claims from the book are unconfirmed and never went through any peer review process), which also puts a considerable dent in javno.com\\'s credibility as a media outlet; lastly - the article was never carried by Reuters and Reuters has got nothing to do with it - Reuters only provided the accompanying photo of a Croatia fan that editors at javno.com used to illustrate the article.

I've let tons of stuff that I posted early on slide because it no longer complied with updated policies.

There is a group who conduct themselves like they are engaged in some sort of war of attrition in the pursuit of a belief that the place needs to be totally bereft of all non-free material regardless of whether or not its use has legitimacy under policy.

It won the [[Brandenburg football championship]] in 1914 and finished runners-up in 1913 and 1915. It took part in the German Championship in 1914, narrowly going out to F\\\\xfcrth in the semi-finals (4-3 aet). The German wikipedia has a [http:\\\\/\\\\/de.wikipedia.org\\\\/wiki\\\\/Berliner_BC_03 little] on it but all traces seem lost after the 1920's. Its the only Berlin champion we don't have an article on as yet, it would be great if you could fill that little gap when you find time. Thanks and all the best, \",\n",

I noticed you removed the link on the Wacker article to the vector version of the 1930s logo I produced, and blanked the image\\'s page. I think I understand your rationale, that a vector version may not be eligible for fair use. I believe vector artwork is not automatically disqualified for fair use images, see, e.g., Image:Coca-Cola logo.svg, also in SVG. Does Wacker M\\\\xfcnchen use this logo any more? I don\\'t know if it\\'s copyrighted; the Germans seem to rely on trademark protection for most logos (no copyright symbol on the Coca-Cola logo, but you do see \\\\\"schutzmark\\\\\" on it). If it has been disused, it may no longer be a trademark. (Notice I did not provide a vector version of the current logo.) Accordingly, I have restored the links and unblanked the vector version\\'s page. I assume you will want to discuss this further...and I will check back here. Cheers! ',\n",

The beer scene here in Ontario, Canada isn\\'t quite as interesting or diverse as it is in the States, but has started to take off in the last 10 years or so as we\\'re seeing changes in Provincial regulation that are allowing the emergence (finally) of craft breweries.

Sometimes it needs to be smaller depending on the type of image (such as a logo, poster, or picture of a person). I look at each image differently since sometimes small text is included in an image which is part of the reason the image is being used. If I question whether the size is sufficient or not, I visit the article and see what impact the size makes. For many of the images being reduced, they're located in infoboxes are already half the size anyway. At WP:FILM we developed our guidelines to state that one of the image's dimensions should be 300px or smaller. This usually covers DVD covers, movie posters, and screenshots. For the most part, this size allows for viewing most of the details of the image (and readers can visit the source link to see a larger size if necessary).

I have no trouble with most of what you have done but (fair warning given) will probably go back and resize some of the stuff that includes multiple images, typically where there are historical logos displayed. They don't have to be huge, but they don't need to be quite so small either. \",\n",

When someone nominates Miscellany for Deletion itself for deletion at Miscellany for Deletion, they are being disruptive, ''at best'' out of an effort to make a joke; and when this comes after a history of 8 other blocks, by different admins, several for disruption, I am not going to insist any admins assume good faith. --\",\n",

However, before I start such a project, I was wondering if you know any such article in Wikipedia already? If there is one already, it would be pretty pointless to have another one. Your templates are kind of summarizing them, but I was rather looking for something detailed enough to be worth studying itself, and not linking to the main articles. Sure if I had time I'd like to learn everything in them, but unfortunately it's rather limited, so I'd rather have a summary. For arteries, for instance, I'd like to know just where they've come from and to where they branch or terminate. So, are there any such articles already, or do I have another project? \",\n",

Chlamydophila, Chlamydophila psittaci, and Chlamydophila pneumonia are particularly important because humans get these diseases and doctors for humans call them CHLAMYDIA such-and-such.  In addition, in the popular news, the Chlamydophila diseases for animals still seem to be called Chlamydia (with no species identification) which is confusing for the general public.  ',\n",

I fear he may wish to include some of his amazing images, original figures and snippets of the text that we already created for our own site (which is presently part of the Johns Hopkins web).  We also used images from the NEI, NIH (which are both free use if given proper acknowledgment) and from other authors' journal articles (for which we got permission).  Though all these images, the quotations from his own journal articles, etc., make our website quite strong, I imagine that they might make copyright issues on Wiki a nightmare.  In addition, even though the images and text are copyrighted elsewhere, I'm wondering if the copyright protection would be lost if they were used on Wikipedia.  Should we have links to standalone pages containing the images (perhaps housed on the Johns Hopkins Web)?  Should we simply write what we can and then have a single image with a link to our page so they can see they full range of images there?  Your input or a redirect to someone better suited to this issue would be most appreciated.  By the by, what you tell me here will be of great value in the future, as well; I would like to work on creating such pages for other diseases that are of particular interest to me.  If I know how to safely use the primary research of professors and therefore am allowed to place it on Wikipedia, the quality of the resultant work will be that much higher.  And don't worry; my main goal is to make ivory-tower advanced level research and clinical knowledge accessible to the common layperson, assuming an 8th-grade reading level, not a post-graduate one.  \",\n",

If such actions are not senseless (have a true military purpose - ending the war asap) they are justified. Hey, it's '''War''', and '''War is Hell''' (if the mob truly thought on this truth they wouldn't scream: WAR! quite so often). Civilians are even today too many times valid military targets. It begins with the workers of the factories of war material, then with the workers of war supplies (food for the troops and the civilian population), and alltoo soon it goes on and on. In the end you bomb whole cities. I know that in our increasingly political correct world such a view is considred amoral, evil, etc. Such persons dream of a pretty pink 'civilized' war where everybody follows 'the rules' and they get amazed that in reality that nobody follows them. They don't study history or war and then scream about its brutality. Let me point out that in Iraq war nearly 200 persons are dying every single day and nobody gives a rat's ass.

I\\'ve added a ref to that effect, but there aren\\'t many references to this condition on PubMed. It seems to be an emerging term to describe [[chest pain]] which has been narrowed down to the aorta, but not narrowed down further yet, and could be due to [[aortic dissection]], [[intramural hematoma]], or a few other conditions. I tend to be hesitant to include items in navboxes unless the terminology is supported by at least one infobox resource, and this one isn\\'t.

Then the version I was working on got erased, so I don't recall anymore where I found it or what the reference was.  I'm quite content to leave it out of any templates for now (and you know about it, so once you're satisfied I trust your ability to slot it into the appropriate template).  I also created [[penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer]] based in part on not wanting a redlinked term and finding a specific reference trying to define the term.  A review would be nice, as always, as well as a quick review of the changes I managed to recover and re-insert in AAS.

They never worked in the past. They won\\'t work in the future. ',\n",

If they had actually been able to find those articles themselves without prompting, they would have done so. Even then, we\\'ve surely all had those blank moments when we can\\'t find something that seems obvious once we\\'ve asked, or once someone else points it out. But this sort of question (essentially \\\\\"I can\\'t find\\\\/understand this information in the articles I\\'ve found, and I can\\'t find the article that should contain this\\\\\") is why the desks were created. If you don\\'t like answering this sort of question, if answering it makes you resent the asker or consider them lazy, then do not answer this sort of quesion.

If we do reach consensus to have it removed, we can then remove the bit you've added to [[WP:ERA]], which I believe defies the whole purpose of WP:ERA's policy of not preferring one notation over the other. If we allow that to stay, eventually people will want to add that BCE\\\\/CE are preferable for Hindu-related articles as well, or Buddhism-related articles, or any ''history-related articles'' at all. I disagree, as I think it is BCE\\\\/CE that are the euphemistic PC terms that should be diminished in use, not the other way around. I think you'd agree. &mdash; '''\",\n",

Zoe was ''possibly'' a little harsh in deleting it straight away -- but I can still see and understand why it has been. I wouldn't advise taking it further because you don't have a good grasp yet of policy to argue your case propery. Also, it's just an article about a TV movie. Nothing serious. Perhaps if you were prepared to write a proper article you could do so under a correct name, such as [[Ebenezer (TV film)]]? Zoe is also correct in her comments about copyright and ownership.

I noticed that you added some upcoming programs. At first glance these have some problems with [[WP:CRYSTAL]]. You have taken care of some of that by providing proper references and dates. However, we still have to be careful about this. Those that work for this network can change there minds. As I remember it the 2nd season of ''Life on Mars'' (one of the best things of the mid 00's by the way) was announced and then got pushed several months away from that date (I think that the popularity of ''Torchwood'' had something to do with that but I could be wrong).

This summary is ''shorter'' at tv.com, and I didn't actually know about the episode guide on scrubs-tv.com -- but I've just [http:\\\\/\\\\/www.scrubs-tv.com\\\\/ep65.html checked] and that's much ''longer''. So, to answer you're question, the article was as original, and is sufficiently different from the two sources you mention. I didn't realise the rest (which I had no hand in crating, but I probably made some frmt tweaks) were copyvios. Shame :( \",\n",
