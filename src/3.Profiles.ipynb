That means that to keep this status, all material in it has to be properly footnoted and sourced. (See [[WP:V]] and [[WP:CITE]] for information on sourcing) In addition, any properly sourced material that IS there now should not be arbitrarily removed without a very good reason that is explained and discussed with other editors.  Each of your edits simply removed properly sourced material with no explanation.  I checked your edit history, and it looks like you\\'ve done this in the past as well.

Buildings can be notable, either because of whom they once housed, or for a totally different reason, perhaps they are a famous theatre, or a historic factory. I am not sure whether your list would be colour specific. The term ''blue plaque'' seems to be the generally accepted term even for plaques which are not blue. I take it to mean a circular monument of any colour. This seems to be how bodies such as English Heritage and those linked externally in the Blue plaques article define them. Despite the main text of the {{Low|Blue plaque}} article the awarding bodies are not just English Heritage and the London councils. They are all over England, I have found (and added to category) one in Wales, I don't know whether there are more, and they exist in Northern Ireland [http:\\\\/\\\\/www.ulsterhistory.co.uk\\\\/index.htm]. I would favour keeping the categories. I find categories useful for browsing related articles and exploring unrelated people or buildings with something in common. The fact that a category does not link a person to a building does not reduce this usefulness. The article itself should describe the relationship. Perhaps a list for people and a list for buildings as well as these categories. My current interest is with architecture and history of buildings so I would appreciate indexing from that direction as well. I vote Strong Keep on the assumption that the recording of historical memorials is not frivolous. I realise that blue plaques in parts of the UK may not be of world-wide interest, but they are a very visible and characteristic sight to tourists. The fact that they have been awarded for 140 years suggests that they are not trivial. \",\n","  'user': 'Oosoom',\n","  'meta': {'is-admin': False},\n","  'reply-to': None,\n","  'timestamp': '1.163920560E09'},\n"," {'id': '121',\n","  'root': '119',\n","  'text': 'Link to deletion debate [http:\\\\/\\\\/en.wikipedia.org\\\\/wiki\\\\/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion\\\\/Log\\\\/2006_November_18#Category:Blue_plaques].

They first duplicated the Smethwick locks (453 - 473 ft), then they dug a new canal to the south of the top summit, but 12 ft lower; and used the top summit to take away the spoil. The new canal was filled with water; that eliminated two locks at each end of the old summit, which were filled in. They then dug another new canal to the south, but 6 foot lower and used the 2nd canal to take away the spoil from the third canal. That eliminated the third lock at each end. These two books state that the top level was not destroyed, just the locks filled in. My memory is seeing only the top of the lock gates.  Broadbridge (page 84) says that the Spon Lane locks were brought to light in July 1969 and destroyed by drag line excavator when the ground was prepared for a motorway. Incidentally Hadfield shows a similar view between pages 96 and 97, but it was taken from the railway end of Brasshouse Lane bridge.

In addition to my requests to move \\\\\"Avatar\\\\\" and \\\\\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\\\\" based on educational value, I also made a request to move \\\\\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\\\\" (see discussion [[Talk:The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)#Requested move 2|here]]). Basically, I think the comic book series, the current primary topic, is not a primary topic because it does not have the educational value that the other moves\\' topics have. It is certainly an originating term for other topics, including the 2012 film, but my impression is that origination is not the criteria. My brief research of the comic book series shows that it is well-known but not necessarily educationally valuable. In addition, I also cited the other Spider-Man films\\' popularity to strongly indicate that the 2012 film will be a contender for reader traffic. I ask about this in part because we have some topical pairings out there where we have the source material as the primary topic and the film adaptation as the secondary topic. For example, we have [[Apt Pupil]] and [[Apt Pupil (film)]]. In contrast, we have [[Road to Perdition]] (film adaptation) and [[Road to Perdition (comics)]] (source material).

I am always puzzled as to why you ask me to do work which you are as capable of doing yourself as I am. We have spoken about this before. Wikipedia is a volunteer charity project, and people do their best in the time they have available to them, and people will tend to work initially in areas that interest them, and then help out on tedious tasks if they have the time or inclination - but nobody is compelled to do anything (well, other than to take care they are not doing harm). That particular splitting you are talking about was a long and complex one that nobody had done for more than two years because of the amount of work involved. Sending people a nag message at the end of it instead of pitching in and helping out yourself is not conducive to the spirit of support, co-operation and collaboration that embodies the spirit of Wikipedia that I respect and enjoy so much. If you spot a spelling mistake - fix it yourself instead of sending someone a message. If you see that an article needs sourcing, it\\'s acceptable to put a general message on the article asking people who are interested in that sort of work to alert them, but it\\'s even better to do the work yourself; it\\'s not really done to pick on the last person who edited the article to ask them to do all the work. You may not have noticed but I did send a message to those people involved in that article letting them know what had happened, and that clean up work might now be needed as I am not an expert on the topic. I know you are well intentioned, but I have already indicated to you that I am uncomfortable with these messages. I would respect you much more if you pitched in and did the work yourself rather than send people these messages. I would love to know that you were helping out by tidying up after me. I would think that was great. Really I would. How about creating a template to be placed on newly created disamb pages that says that work on sorting them out needs to be done. And the template could put such articles into a category to enable editors to work through all the articles that need attention. I think a general message would be more in the spirit of Wikipedia than putting the weight all on one person. If we make a task too onerous for one person, then that task will be ignored.  <span style=\\\\\"border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;\\\\\">\\'\\'\\'',\n","  'user': 'SilkTork',\n","  'meta': {'is-admin': True},\n","  'reply-to': '480632',\n","  'timestamp': '1.298050980E09'},\n"," {'id': '480634',\n","  'root': '480632',\n","  'text': 'SilkTork, every month I fix several thousand disambiguation links left behind by editors like yourself, so don\\'t worry about whether I \\\\\"pitch in\\\\\" or not.

I would rather if every sub stub I\\'d created was created as a full length article first time of course... I think it comes down to viewpoint and whether you view wikipedia as an ongoing development which will be around for hundreds of years or an encyclopedia which should be slowly written an article at a time more fully... At times I share either one of these outlooks which is reflective in my writing and the time I spend on each article.... What upset me Malleus was that even before we\\'d really met and conversed you seemed to despise me and viewed me as a \\\\\"bad egg\\\\\". Maybe its because of my many stubs or I\\'ve done something in the past to hack you off in a public forum because of my view on something or other I don\\'t know but I can assure that we are both here to improve wikipedia together... I think it is a \\'\\'good\\'\\' thing that you review so many articles and seem to genuinely want to improve our percentage of good articles. As you say, something motivates us to edit in what at times can be an exasperating and belligerent environment, its the love of knowledge and resourcefulness I think.. Anyway lets put this behind us as you say and in future should our paths cross I will try to show greater respect for each others work\\\\/efforts and hope that you would do the same...  \\\\u2666 ',\n","  'user': 'Dr. Blofeld',\n","  'meta': {'is-admin': False},\n","  'reply-to': None,\n","  'timestamp': '1.296166740E09'},\n"," {'id': '262403',\n","  'root': '262402',\n","  'text': 'When have you seen a \\\\\"not so good review\\\\\" from me?

Sources that you're citing should be footnoted inline, although if you're using multiple pages from one reference (say a book or a long journal article) in different areas you can use a short format inline and give the full reference information in a seperate section. See [[Cleveland Bay]] for an example of the short\\\\/long formatting that I'm talking about - completely different subject, but same general idea.

My ribbons and medals aren\\'t special.  They give me respect for the real awards.  World War I, France: a shell landed in my grandfather\\'s trench.  Ripped his right leg, lodged some fragments in his back.  Everyone else was hit even worse.  Nobody came to help them and nobody else could stand up.  So my grandfather started making his way toward the nearest field hospital.  On the way there an ambulance met him and he directed them to his trench, telling them he\\'d keep walking.  They went, but by then it was too late for the rest of his unit: all dead or dying  On the trip back the ambulance driver offered him a ride, and when he declined a second time they ordered him into the ambulance.  Just as he stepped into it a second shell landed, killing everyone else in the ambulance.  By some miracle my grandfather wasn\\'t touched.  So he walked the rest of the two miles to the field hospital.  When a doctor finally saw him the doc asked how he had gotten there and thought it was a lie when my grandfather told the truth.

We can\\'t take sides.  I hope this explains things.  If not, feel free to discuss your concerns at [[Talk:Nokota horse]] and we can try to further sort matters out.

Buildings can be notable, either because of whom they once housed, or for a totally different reason, perhaps they are a famous theatre, or a historic factory. I am not sure whether your list would be colour specific. The term ''blue plaque'' seems to be the generally accepted term even for plaques which are not blue. I take it to mean a circular monument of any colour. This seems to be how bodies such as English Heritage and those linked externally in the Blue plaques article define them. Despite the main text of the {{Low|Blue plaque}} article the awarding bodies are not just English Heritage and the London councils. They are all over England, I have found (and added to category) one in Wales, I don't know whether there are more, and they exist in Northern Ireland [http:\\\\/\\\\/www.ulsterhistory.co.uk\\\\/index.htm]. I would favour keeping the categories. I find categories useful for browsing related articles and exploring unrelated people or buildings with something in common. The fact that a category does not link a person to a building does not reduce this usefulness. The article itself should describe the relationship. Perhaps a list for people and a list for buildings as well as these categories. My current interest is with architecture and history of buildings so I would appreciate indexing from that direction as well. I vote Strong Keep on the assumption that the recording of historical memorials is not frivolous. I realise that blue plaques in parts of the UK may not be of world-wide interest, but they are a very visible and characteristic sight to tourists. The fact that they have been awarded for 140 years suggests that they are not trivial. \",\n","  'user': 'Oosoom',\n","  'meta': {'is-admin': False},\n","  'reply-to': None,\n","  'timestamp': '1.163920560E09'},\n"," {'id': '121',\n","  'root': '119',\n","  'text': 'Link to deletion debate [http:\\\\/\\\\/en.wikipedia.org\\\\/wiki\\\\/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion\\\\/Log\\\\/2006_November_18#Category:Blue_plaques].

They first duplicated the Smethwick locks (453 - 473 ft), then they dug a new canal to the south of the top summit, but 12 ft lower; and used the top summit to take away the spoil. The new canal was filled with water; that eliminated two locks at each end of the old summit, which were filled in. They then dug another new canal to the south, but 6 foot lower and used the 2nd canal to take away the spoil from the third canal. That eliminated the third lock at each end. These two books state that the top level was not destroyed, just the locks filled in. My memory is seeing only the top of the lock gates.  Broadbridge (page 84) says that the Spon Lane locks were brought to light in July 1969 and destroyed by drag line excavator when the ground was prepared for a motorway.

Basically, I think the comic book series, the current primary topic, is not a primary topic because it does not have the educational value that the other moves\\' topics have. It is certainly an originating term for other topics, including the 2012 film, but my impression is that origination is not the criteria. My brief research of the comic book series shows that it is well-known but not necessarily educationally valuable. In addition, I also cited the other Spider-Man films\\' popularity to strongly indicate that the 2012 film will be a contender for reader traffic. I ask about this in part because we have some topical pairings out there where we have the source material as the primary topic and the film adaptation as the secondary topic. For example, we have [[Apt Pupil]] and [[Apt Pupil (film)]]. In contrast, we have [[Road to Perdition]] (film adaptation) and [[Road to Perdition (comics)]] (source material).

I am always puzzled as to why you ask me to do work which you are as capable of doing yourself as I am. We have spoken about this before. Wikipedia is a volunteer charity project, and people do their best in the time they have available to them, and people will tend to work initially in areas that interest them, and then help out on tedious tasks if they have the time or inclination - but nobody is compelled to do anything (well, other than to take care they are not doing harm). That particular splitting you are talking about was a long and complex one that nobody had done for more than two years because of the amount of work involved. Sending people a nag message at the end of it instead of pitching in and helping out yourself is not conducive to the spirit of support, co-operation and collaboration that embodies the spirit of Wikipedia that I respect and enjoy so much. If you spot a spelling mistake - fix it yourself instead of sending someone a message. If you see that an article needs sourcing, it\\'s acceptable to put a general message on the article asking people who are interested in that sort of work to alert them, but it\\'s even better to do the work yourself; it\\'s not really done to pick on the last person who edited the article to ask them to do all the work. You may not have noticed but I did send a message to those people involved in that article letting them know what had happened, and that clean up work might now be needed as I am not an expert on the topic. I know you are well intentioned, but I have already indicated to you that I am uncomfortable with these messages. I would respect you much more if you pitched in and did the work yourself rather than send people these messages. I would love to know that you were helping out by tidying up after me. I would think that was great. Really I would. How about creating a template to be placed on newly created disamb pages that says that work on sorting them out needs to be done. And the template could put such articles into a category to enable editors to work through all the articles that need attention. I think a general message would be more in the spirit of Wikipedia than putting the weight all on one person. If we make a task too onerous for one person, then that task will be ignored.  <span style=\\\\\"border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;\\\\\">\\'\\'\\'',\n","  'user': 'SilkTork',\n","  'meta': {'is-admin': True},\n","  'reply-to': '480632',\n","  'timestamp': '1.298050980E09'},\n"," {'id': '480634',\n","  'root': '480632',\n","  'text': 'SilkTork, every month I fix several thousand disambiguation links left behind by editors like yourself, so don\\'t worry about whether I \\\\\"pitch in\\\\\" or not.

I\\'ve always tried to meet our goals to \\\\\"built an encyclopedia of the highest quality\\\\\" and \\\\\"the sum of all human knowledge\\\\\" which has meant that the quality of my contributions has often differed dramatically as we only have a limited amount of time to get done what we want.

I would rather if every sub stub I\\'d created was created as a full length article first time of course... I think it comes down to viewpoint and whether you view wikipedia as an ongoing development which will be around for hundreds of years or an encyclopedia which should be slowly written an article at a time more fully... At times I share either one of these outlooks which is reflective in my writing and the time I spend on each article....

Sources that you're citing should be footnoted inline, although if you're using multiple pages from one reference (say a book or a long journal article) in different areas you can use a short format inline and give the full reference information in a seperate section.

So, whomever did this needs to publicly state that they are in a position of authority within the ATA to license the text put on Wikipedia under the Creative Commons license, even with the above terms of use on truckline.com. \",\n","  'user': 'Davemeistermoab',\n","  'meta': {'is-admin': True},\n","  'reply-to': '380',\n","  'timestamp': '1.276247700E09'},\n"," {'id': '382',\n","  'root': '380',\n","  'text': 'Ok thats all I wanted to know.

They both do show nudity and sexual activity, on screen. We\\'ve decided that since Madame Aema was made only to capitalize on the nudity and sexual activity, it fits in the project. Ppong is a literary adaptation of some artistic quality, and, basically, a sex-farce. (I\\'m still a little uncomfortable with the subjectivity of this decision, but so it goes...) Both get the \\\\\"Erotic film\\\\\" category though. Am I the only one who has difficulty with the Pornography label? It does seem a bit of a value-judgment, at least in my thinking...
