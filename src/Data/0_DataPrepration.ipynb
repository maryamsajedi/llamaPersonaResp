I just wanted to ask you, if you happen to be continuing to maintain the article as you so ably have in the past, to kind of keep an eye out for the return of Canadianism, if it should show up. Mr. Cage vigorously contests its accuracy. --\",\n",

Regarding the [[WUDO]], the organization existed for slightly over three years, and while the ''TIME'' magazine article (Note 2) mentioned a land exercise planned for the Fall of 1949 as a follow up to [[Exercise Verity]].  However, I haven't found any subsequuent mention of that exercise.  So it appears that Exercise Verity was the only major military operation undertaken by the WUDO.  In any case, it seems that WUDO was a placeholder for the eventual creation of [[NATO]] and [[SHAPE]].  Your thoughts?\",\n",

The Nokota horse article has been designated as a \\\\\"good article\\\\\" under wikipedia\\'s [[WP:GA]] criteria.  That means that to keep this status, all material in it has to be properly footnoted and sourced. (See [[WP:V]] and [[WP:CITE]] for information on sourcing) In addition, any properly sourced material that IS there now should not be arbitrarily removed without a very good reason that is explained and discussed with other editors.  Each of your edits simply removed properly sourced material with no explanation.  I checked your edit history, and it looks like you\\'ve done this in the past as well.  The best way to handle what you want to do is to click on the \\\\\"discussion\\\\\" link at the top of the page, and then on the talk page for the article, explain your concerns.  I noted that the material you removed concerns a dispute between the two Nokota horse organizations.  The dispute itself, at least until settled, is a controversy that is noteworthy and relevant to include. (We\\'ve had to manage a similar set of legal disputes involving the Andalusian horse registries at its article too)  Wikipedia takes a [[WP:NPOV|neutral position]] on these issues and attempts to simply explain the controversy and outline the views of each side.  We can\\'t take sides.  I hope this explains things.  If not, feel free to discuss your concerns at [[Talk:Nokota horse]] and we can try to further sort matters out. ',\n",

Buildings can be notable, either because of whom they once housed, or for a totally different reason, perhaps they are a famous theatre, or a historic factory. I am not sure whether your list would be colour specific. The term ''blue plaque'' seems to be the generally accepted term even for plaques which are not blue. I take it to mean a circular monument of any colour. This seems to be how bodies such as English Heritage and those linked externally in the Blue plaques article define them. Despite the main text of the {{Low|Blue plaque}} article the awarding bodies are not just English Heritage and the London councils. They are all over England, I have found (and added to category) one in Wales, I don't know whether there are more, and they exist in Northern Ireland [http:\\\\/\\\\/www.ulsterhistory.co.uk\\\\/index.htm]. I would favour keeping the categories. I find categories useful for browsing related articles and exploring unrelated people or buildings with something in common. The fact that a category does not link a person to a building does not reduce this usefulness. The article itself should describe the relationship. Perhaps a list for people and a list for buildings as well as these categories. My current interest is with architecture and history of buildings so I would appreciate indexing from that direction as well. I vote Strong Keep on the assumption that the recording of historical memorials is not frivolous. I realise that blue plaques in parts of the UK may not be of world-wide interest, but they are a very visible and characteristic sight to tourists. The fact that they have been awarded for 140 years suggests that they are not trivial. \",\n",

The criteria that Jappalang is concerned about is [[WP:NFCC]] #8, which states that non-free content should only be used when it \\\\\"significantly increase readers\\' understanding of the topic, and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding\\\\\". If you have a source which gives more \\\\\"critical commentary on the artistic design of the customized plates\\\\\" (Jappalang\\'s wording), then we should add this in to the article in order to make a case for keeping the image.

Both books say that the plan was to reduce the Smethwick top level by 18 foot, down to the Wolverhampton level, thereby eliminating three locks at each end of the summmit. They first duplicated the Smethwick locks (453 - 473 ft), then they dug a new canal to the south of the top summit, but 12 ft lower; and used the top summit to take away the spoil. The new canal was filled with water; that eliminated two locks at each end of the old summit, which were filled in. They then dug another new canal to the south, but 6 foot lower and used the 2nd canal to take away the spoil from the third canal. That eliminated the third lock at each end. These two books state that the top level was not destroyed, just the locks filled in. My memory is seeing only the top of the lock gates.  Broadbridge (page 84) says that the Spon Lane locks were brought to light in July 1969 and destroyed by drag line excavator when the ground was prepared for a motorway. Incidentally Hadfield shows a similar view between pages 96 and 97, but it was taken from the railway end of Brasshouse Lane bridge. I cannot at the moment remember if I saw locks at both ends of the summit. I could have been there in July 1969, but the memory I'm talking about was a boat hire over Christmas \\\\/ New Year either 1973 or 1974; we went into a supermarket in Smethwick to buy food for 12 people.\",\n",

Then it seems the issue was with sourcing, which I could do something about (I added a specific link to the New York Times 1911 article) but then I read it again, and it seems the issue was that this is a list and not an article, and I don't know much about lists.

Basically, I think the comic book series, the current primary topic, is not a primary topic because it does not have the educational value that the other moves\\' topics have. It is certainly an originating term for other topics, including the 2012 film, but my impression is that origination is not the criteria. My brief research of the comic book series shows that it is well-known but not necessarily educationally valuable. In addition, I also cited the other Spider-Man films\\' popularity to strongly indicate that the 2012 film will be a contender for reader traffic. I ask about this in part because we have some topical pairings out there where we have the source material as the primary topic and the film adaptation as the secondary topic. For example, we have [[Apt Pupil]] and [[Apt Pupil (film)]]. In contrast, we have [[Road to Perdition]] (film adaptation) and [[Road to Perdition (comics)]] (source material).

The article is somewhat controversial, about a probably living person, and basically unsourced. Porn stars are controversial by their nature, but due to her specialty, this one seems to be more controversial than some. There is a strong argument in [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons]] that all unsourced derogatory or controversial information about living persons should be deleted outright; this whole article isn't obviously at that level, but it isn't that far from it. I looked a while on the web, and I couldn't find any [[Wikipedia:reliable sources]] writing about her, or even backing Alkivar's claim from [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\\\\/Tove Jensen]], which seems to be why it wasn't deleted then. There are lots of image galleries, but that doesn't mean much; the ones who want to publish actual information about here refer ... to our article! I've looked at the PDFs referenced from the article talk page, and they aren't conclusive proof of anything, and even if they were, they would probably be primary sources. :-( The article isn't slanderous, but I strongly doubt it could stand up to another deletion challenge, which makes the question of age rather moot. --\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Hi JaGa. I am always puzzled as to why you ask me to do work which you are as capable of doing yourself as I am. We have spoken about this before. Wikipedia is a volunteer charity project, and people do their best in the time they have available to them, and people will tend to work initially in areas that interest them, and then help out on tedious tasks if they have the time or inclination - but nobody is compelled to do anything (well, other than to take care they are not doing harm). That particular splitting you are talking about was a long and complex one that nobody had done for more than two years because of the amount of work involved. Sending people a nag message at the end of it instead of pitching in and helping out yourself is not conducive to the spirit of support, co-operation and collaboration that embodies the spirit of Wikipedia that I respect and enjoy so much. If you spot a spelling mistake - fix it yourself instead of sending someone a message. If you see that an article needs sourcing, it\\'s acceptable to put a general message on the article asking people who are interested in that sort of work to alert them, but it\\'s even better to do the work yourself; it\\'s not really done to pick on the last person who edited the article to ask them to do all the work. You may not have noticed but I did send a message to those people involved in that article letting them know what had happened, and that clean up work might now be needed as I am not an expert on the topic. I know you are well intentioned, but I have already indicated to you that I am uncomfortable with these messages. I would respect you much more if you pitched in and did the work yourself rather than send people these messages. I would love to know that you were helping out by tidying up after me. I would think that was great. Really I would. How about creating a template to be placed on newly created disamb pages that says that work on sorting them out needs to be done. And the template could put such articles into a category to enable editors to work through all the articles that need attention. I think a general message would be more in the spirit of Wikipedia than putting the weight all on one person. If we make a task too onerous for one person, then that task will be ignored.  <span style=\\\\\"border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;\\\\\">\\'\\'\\'',\n",

I\\'ve always tried to meet our goals to \\\\\"built an encyclopedia of the highest quality\\\\\" and \\\\\"the sum of all human knowledge\\\\\" which has meant that the quality of my contributions has often differed dramatically as we only have a limited amount of time to get done what we want. Unfortunately in trying to get some mention of the thousands of topics I\\'ve started on wikipedia to work towards \\\\\"the sum\\\\\" this has affected article quality, often embarrasingly so but I can\\'t accompliosh what I want to in the time I have, that\\'s the problem... I would rather if every sub stub I\\'d created was created as a full length article first time of course... I think it comes down to viewpoint and whether you view wikipedia as an ongoing development which will be around for hundreds of years or an encyclopedia which should be slowly written an article at a time more fully... At times I share either one of these outlooks which is reflective in my writing and the time I spend on each article.... What upset me Malleus was that even before we\\'d really met and conversed you seemed to despise me and viewed me as a \\\\\"bad egg\\\\\". Maybe its because of my many stubs or I\\'ve done something in the past to hack you off in a public forum because of my view on something or other I don\\'t know but I can assure that we are both here to improve wikipedia together... I think it is a \\'\\'good\\'\\' thing that you review so many articles and seem to genuinely want to improve our percentage of good articles. As you say, something motivates us to edit in what at times can be an exasperating and belligerent environment, its the love of knowledge and resourcefulness I think..

And besides this, none of the tags relate to living people. You also may have trouble with the whole section when\\\\/if you go to FAC - they tend to be a bit less forgiving of lists and some reviewers may see it as trivia. I can see the points on both sides of this last argument, and am not telling you it has to be changed or people will laugh you out of the building, but just pointing out something to think about. Hope this helps. ',\n",

I took a quick look at the article and it looks like you're basically doing a good job. To quickly answer a couple of your questions - references should be inline, not on a seperate page. Sources that you're citing should be footnoted inline, although if you're using multiple pages from one reference (say a book or a long journal article) in different areas you can use a short format inline and give the full reference information in a seperate section. See [[Cleveland Bay]] for an example of the short\\\\/long formatting that I'm talking about - completely different subject, but same general idea. I'll have to take a look at the move history to answer your question on the move, and will do that when I get home.

[http:\\\\/\\\\/en.wikipedia.org\\\\/w\\\\/index.php?title=Sora_Aoi&diff=171926198&oldid=171324015 in this edit] an anonymous editor has added an interesting little tidbit to the [[Sora Aoi]] article. It is sourced, reliably, I think with a clip of the group making this statement on a television program. The only problem may be that this clip is at YouTube, which I know is usually frowned upon.

However, there is a group of very good science and history editors out there that often pick up the horse articles. The article has only been up for a week, which is a fairly short waiting period at GAN (unfortunately, there's a fairly constant backlog there).

While the couple are unknowingly rushing towards the Grand Canyon, a planted [[Arizona State Route 64]] shield is visible. The real AZ-64 leads to the Grand Canyon; however, this scene was actually shot in my usernamesake town of Moab.

For example, I got an [[Aerial Achievement Medal]] for every 20 recon missions I flew, even when the missions were as routine as could be. I got a [[Combat Readiness Medal]] for every two years I collected flight pay. Medals mostly just indicate how good your supervisor is at writing up a citation. I\\'ve known chiefs and generals with chestfuls of fruit salad, up to and including the [[Bronze Star]] and [[Legion of Merit]], who were absolutely freaking worthless and couldn\\'t lead sailors into a whorehouse. I\\'ve also known people who accomplished amazing, courageous things who got jack because nobody important happened to be looking. [[Medal of Honor]]? Impressive. Same goes for the [[Silver Star]] and the [[Distinguished Service Cross]]. But even [[Purple Heart]]s and [[Bronze Star]]s are sometimes gimmes now - those medals has been frequently degraded at least since Vietnam (given out for scratches, sometimes), so don\\'t be impressed unless you see the citation. Sorry, didn\\'t mean to rant, but GIs bragging about their medals sometimes makes me want to bring out the smackdown. Durova, this isn\\'t directed at you, but at the creeping careerism in American military culture. :) ',\n",

They went, but by then it was too late for the rest of his unit: all dead or dying  On the trip back the ambulance driver offered him a ride, and when he declined a second time they ordered him into the ambulance.  Just as he stepped into it a second shell landed, killing everyone else in the ambulance.  By some miracle my grandfather wasn\\'t touched.  So he walked the rest of the two miles to the field hospital.  When a doctor finally saw him the doc asked how he had gotten there and thought it was a lie when my grandfather told the truth.

[[Pornography]] is defined in our article as \\\\\"the explicit representation of the human body or sexual activity with the goal of sexual arousal and\\\\/or sexual relief.\\\\\" If the nudity or sex isn\\'t explicitly presented on the screen, but just hinted at, it\\'s not pornography by that definition, no matter how erotic it is. I haven\\'t seen either of those two films so will have to use a different one for an example: have you seen \\'\\'[[Tampopo]]\\'\\'? There is a scene there where a couple kiss to pass a raw egg back and forth until it breaks. Or if you haven\\'t seen that, you\\'ve surely seen at least one of any number of videos of girls suggestively eating lollipops or bananas. That\\'s all pretty clearly sexy, but all implicit, not explicit. --',\n",

But I wouldn\\'t even think about calling it an erotic film, much less porn. That would be like calling [[King Lear]] a comedy because the Fool cracks a few jokes. Anyway, I worked out a solution with a Korean editor-- We\\'ve decided Madame Aema is soft porn, Ppong is not. They both do show nudity and sexual activity, on screen. We\\'ve decided that since Madame Aema was made only to capitalize on the nudity and sexual activity, it fits in the project. Ppong is a literary adaptation of some artistic quality, and, basically, a sex-farce. (I\\'m still a little uncomfortable with the subjectivity of this decision, but so it goes...) Both get the \\\\\"Erotic film\\\\\" category though. Am I the only one who has difficulty with the Pornography label? It does seem a bit of a value-judgment, at least in my thinking... If something with nudity & strong sexuality is done very well, then it\\'s not porn, it\\'s erotic cinema. On the other hand, porn is porn and there\\'s no mistaking it, if you get my drift. ',\n",
