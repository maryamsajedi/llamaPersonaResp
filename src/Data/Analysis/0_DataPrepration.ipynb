       "               'text': 'on a side note, i think it is interesting that the haplogroup c3 ychromosomes found among koreans appear to belong to a different cluster from those that are found at extremely high frequencies among mongols, kazakhs, and tungus. i\\'m eagerly anticipating a study that might shed some light on the origins of the haplogroup c3 element among koreans personally, i have a hunch that the korean c3 element might be related in large part to the modal haplotype of the nivkhs, because i think that the ancient protokoreans absorbed some sort of nivkhlike population a lot of korean people just \"look like\" nivkhs, and there are many interesting koreannivkh linguistic parallels as well, all of which seem to suggest some sort of nivkhrelated substratum in the korean language. another reason for assuming either a recent expansion of c3 among the koreans or an introduction of c3 into the korean population from a foreign source either substratal, e.g. from the protonivkhs, or, less likely, adstratal, e.g. from mongols or manchus is that c3 as a whole is very infrequent among the japanese and, as far as i know, has not been found at all among samples of ryukyuans, which suggests that the occurrence of haplogroup c3 among modern japanese is probably due mostly to assimilation of either asian immigrants or ainus, although the presence of c3a in japan at a very low frequency suggests that c3 might actually have a long history as a minor haplogroup in japan. in any case, if there is any truth to the posited protohistoric relationship between at least a certain segment of the japanese and the koreans, then haplogroup c3 could not have been a major element among the protokorean population of that time, because it is not found among the ryukyuans and it is only a very minor element in the japanese population as a whole, whereas it accounts for some onesixth of the entire korean population. of course, the ratio of c3 in modern koreans compared to modern japanese would also make sense if the japanese were only about 16 to 15 korean, and the ryukyuans basically not korean at all, as that would be sufficient to produce the frequency of c3 that is found among the modern japanese. in this case, i would guess that haplogroup n1, which is found among the populations of some cities in japan, and probably also some o2b1 and o3 in addition to c3 would be attributable to korean influence. i think the frequencies of those haplogroups among the japanese would ultimately add up to approximately 15 or 16 of the japanese ychromosome distribution, so this actually might be a good working hypothesis for explaining the presence of c3 among the japanese but apparent absence from the ryukyuan population.',\n",
